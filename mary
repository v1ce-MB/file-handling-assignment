 curious by nature, Alex loves to ask questions and dive deep into his studies. His favorite color is blue, which he feels represents the ocean and the sky, bringing him a sense of calm. Outside of academics, he enjoys spending time outdoors, whether hiking or hanging out with friends. Alex is excited to see what this year has in store for him!
